steam (1:1.0.0.82) beta; urgency=medium

  * Build using updated Steam client:
    - Client timestamp 1726604483 (2024-09-17)
    - Steam Runtime (scout) version 0.20240806.97925
  * Packaging:
    - Convert steam-launcher from Architecture: all to amd64.
      Steam requires an x86_64 operating system since at least 2020, and
      making the packaging reflect this allows us to pull in basic x86_64
      dependencies more reliably. (steamrt/tasks#441)
    - Recommend libxkbcommon{,-x11-}0 on both amd64 and i386.
      When combined with Steam Linux Runtime changes, this avoids crashes
      in some SLR games on systems where a Vulkan layer depends on
      libxkbcommon, for example MangoHud 0.7.2. (steamrt/tasks#530)
  * Expand the bootstrap tarball:
    - Add steam-runtime-check-requirements.
      This allows some basic requirements to be checked as early as
      possible in the installation process. (steamrt/tasks#441)
    - Add steam-runtime-identify-library-abi and its dependencies.
      This avoids a confusing warning message and speeds up first-time
      Steam Runtime setup. (steamrt/tasks#441)
    - Add srt-logger (steamrt/tasks#447)
    - Add 32-bit libcurl and its dependencies for the crash report uploader,
      so that crashes and assertion failures during first-time startup can
      be reported (steamrt/tasks#539)
    - Add fonts required by the Steam client, avoiding an assertion failure
      during first-time startup (steamrt/tasks#538)
  * bin_steam.sh:
    - Start writing to console-linux.txt as early as possible, using the
      srt-logger tool (steamrt/tasks#447)
    - Try harder to create ~/.steam/steam atomically.

  * Specifically require gnome-terminal, konsole or xterm, and don't accept

    trying to start before its dependencies have been installed, which will
    fail. (Reopens: steam-for-linux#9265)

  * Packaging:
    - Depend on Python 3.4.
      This was available in Debian since version 8 (EOL long ago), in Ubuntu
      since 14.04 (EOL), and in SteamOS 2 (EOL).
    - Depend on pkexec in preference to policykit-1, avoiding installation
      of a deprecated transitional package on Debian >= 12 and
      Ubuntu >= 22.04. Older versions that only have policykit-1 still work.
  * steamdeps installer script:
    - Turn off autoremovals when steamdeps runs apt, avoiding
      a failure to install dependencies if autoremovals were enabled
      system-wide (steam-for-linux#9350)
    - Accept any x-terminal-emulator as a terminal (steam-for-linux#9265)
    - Try harder to tell apt's conflict resolution heuristic
      that removing steam-launcher is not a good solution
      (followup for steam-for-linux#9301)
    - Remove compatibility with Python 3.2
    - Use shutil.which instead of which(1), for better efficiency and to
      avoid deprecation warnings in some versions

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Don't install apt repository key into /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d.
    In modern versions of apt the recommendation is to install third-party
    repository keys into locations not trusted by apt by default,
    and use the signed-by field in sources.list.d entries to request
    validation against those keys for a specific repository, limiting
    security exposure.
    This configuration change requires apt 1.1 or later, dropping support
    for Ubuntu 12.04 'precise' and Ubuntu 14.04 'trusty' (both of which have
    already reached end-of-life). The apt repository continues to provide
    a 'precise' suite for historical reasons.
    On upgrades from earlier versions, steam.gpg is removed from
    /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d. If it has local system administrator
    modifications (which it should not) then the modified version is kept
    as steam.gpg.dpkg-bak but is no longer used, unless merged by the system
    administrator.
    Similarly, on upgrades from earlier versions, steam.list is removed
    from /etc/apt/sources.list.d. If it has local system administrator
    modifications, most commonly to enable the beta steam-launcher, then
    the modified version is kept as steam.list.dpkg-bak but is no longer
    used unless merged by the system administrator.
    New apt source configuration is provided in steam-stable.list (for the
    stable version) and steam-beta.list (for the beta version, commented
    out by default), so that beta users will not usually need to edit
    steam-stable.list. (steamrt/tasks#245)
  * Build using updated Steam client:

    packages in Debian/Ubuntu

  [ Ludovico de Nittis ]
  * bin_steamdeps: Remove workarounds for Ubuntu 14.04 and earlier.
    With the requirement of apt 1.1 or later, we effectively dropped support
    for the EOL Ubuntu releases 12.04 and 14.04.
    This allows us to remove some workarounds we had in place to support
    those distros.

  * Add Recommends on libfontconfig1:i386 and libnm0:i386.
    Those libraries are already included in the scout Steam Runtime,
    but the versions from the host distribution are likely to interoperate
    better with a modern /etc/fonts and NetworkManager. (steamrt/tasks#118)

  * bin_steamdeps: Ensure that packages are never removed.
    In some situations, e.g. if a user installs a newer version of
    libc6:amd64 and then removes its apt source, resulting in it being
    newer than any available version of libc6:i386, apt would suggest
    removing several essential packages in order to satisfy the
    dependencies. Don't let it do that.
    (Resolves: steam-for-linux#7982)
  * bin_steamdeps: Explicitly ask apt for both :amd64 and :i386 versions of

steam (1:1.0.0.62) beta; urgency=medium

  * build: Adapt for newer Steam Runtime builds.
    In newer runtimes, steam-runtime/i386 is populated with symlinks
    into steam-runtime/lib and steam-runtime/usr, rather than containing
    regular files.
  * build: Populate source package using a Python script.
    This takes care of downloading all the necessary bits from the Steam
    client, and repacking the Steam runtime and some other Steam binaries
    into the bootstrap tarball.
  * debian: Add an epoch to the version number.
    This makes this package supersede the outdated steam package in Ubuntu,
    which has an epoch as a result of an unrelated package "sTeam" that
    existed in historical Ubuntu versions.
  * Take over responsibility for steam_tray_mono.png,
    bin_steam.sh, bin_steamdeps.py from Steam client.
  * bin_steam.sh: Remove redirection to a log file.
    This is not particularly useful in practice, and can easily be replaced
    with ordinary Unix shell redirection when debugging the client or a
    game. We can't rely on it anyway, because third-party packages don't
    tend to do this. (Fixes: steam-for-linux#6901)
  * bin_steam.sh: Add a brief header identifying this file
  * bin_steam.sh: Simplify version management by making it dotted-decimal
  * bin_steam.sh: Include full .deb version number, except for epoch
  * bin_steam.sh: If run directly, default to non-beta Steam universe
  * bin_steam.sh: Use a more robust way to set up ~/.steam/steam symlink
  * bin_steam.sh: Make Ubuntu 20.04 show the .desktop file as "trusted"
  * bin_steam.sh: chmod the .desktop file a+x, not just +x.
    To mark a .desktop file as "trusted" on most desktops, it needs to be
    a+x, which differs from +x under a restrictive umask.
  * bin_steam.sh: Only copy .desktop file to desktop if system-wide.
    The .desktop file hard-codes the path to the executable, so it's only
    suitable for system-wide installations.
  * bin_steam.sh: Prefer content that is adjacent to the script.
    Install all the essential bits into $(pkglibdir).
  * bin_steam.sh: Exit unsuccessfully if a command fails.
  * Add steam and steamdeps symlinks.
    The README says you can run ./steam, so let's make sure you can.
  * bin_steamdeps.py: Use python3.
    Python 2 is EOL, and will not be in Ubuntu 20.04.
    (Fixes steam-for-linux#6869, #6634)
  * bin_steamdeps.py: Cope with Ubuntu 14.04 graphics stack backported
    to 12.04. (Note that the Steam client is no longer supported on 12.04.)
  * bin_steamdeps.py: Print diagnostics to stderr.
    If we print them to stdout, which is fully-buffered by default, then
    they will not necessarily be shown before we actually try to install
    the packages in question.
    Instead, print them to stderr, which is line-buffered by default.
  * bin_steamdeps.py: Fall back to x-terminal-emulator.
  * bin_steamdeps.py: Install libgl1 instead of libgl1-mesa-glx if GLVND.
    libgl1 is the GLVND dispatcher, and replaces the transitional package
    libgl1-mesa-glx, which is likely to disappear in future versions of
    Debian/Ubuntu.
  * bin_steamdeps.py: Remap package names, not complete dependencies.
    This is a lot simpler, and is all we actually need in practice.
  * bin_steamdeps.py: Explicitly depend on amd64 libc and GL stack
  * bin_steamdeps.py: Ignore python-apt.
    Steam claims to need python-apt, but as far as anyone can tell, it
    actually doesn't. (Part of steam-for-linux#6869, #6634)
  * debian: Depend on apt instead of python-apt.
    We ask for python-apt, but we don't seem to actually use it; the
    bin_steamdeps.py script calls out to apt subprocesses instead.
    (Part of steam-for-linux#6869, #6634)
  * debian: Recommend xdg-utils, except on SteamOS
    (Fixes steam-for-linux#2200)
  * debian: Build-Depend on dh-python, with alternative for older distros.
    Building the source package on anything newer than Ubuntu 12.04 'precise'
    or SteamRT 1 'scout' will need dh-python.
  * d/control: Build-depend on perl, for prove(1)
    This is used to run QA checks.
  * Move bootstrap and version checks from Makefile into tests/
  * check_version.sh: Cope with epoch and/or suffix in package version
  * Import steam-devices udev rules from
    <https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-devices/> as a subproject:
    - add ZeroPlus P4 (hitbox) hidraw device, 0c12:0ef6
  * Add brief details of the subprojects and their bug reporting addresses
  * d/copyright: Add copyright/licensing details for some open-source parts
    of this package
  * Add some .gitignore files
  * Remove references to steamrepo@list.valvesoftware.com.
    This mailing list no longer exists.
  * d/README.source: Add some documentation for maintainers
  * Ship a known-good binary-blob public key, taken from 1.0.0.61.
    We install this into /etc, so it isn't great if it changes every time
    we rebuild the package. Freeze it at a known-good version, and
    document how to regenerate it in debian/README.source.
